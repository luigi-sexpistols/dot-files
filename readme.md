# Luigi's Dot Files

Dot files are configuration files on Unix-like systems (such as Linux) whose names begin with a dot (`.`). Examples include `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, and `.vimrc`. These files are typically hidden by default in file listings and are used to store user-specific settings for applications and environments.

## Key Points
- Dot files are hidden by default (use `ls -a` to view them).
- They store configuration and preferences for programs.
- Editing dot files allows users to customize their environment.

## Common Dot Files
- `.bashrc`: Bash shell configuration
- `.gitconfig`: Git settings
- `.vimrc`: Vim editor configuration

Dot files are essential for personalizing and managing your Unix-like system environment.
